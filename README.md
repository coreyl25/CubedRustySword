📚 Story
The Tale of Russell
Russell was once the kingdom's most celebrated knight—flawless in his missions and beloved by all. But during a final confrontation with Rantor the Goblin King, the Queen was killed, and Russell blamed himself. Consumed by guilt despite having mortally wounded the Goblin King, Russell retired from knighthood.
Now, years later, Rantor has returned and kidnapped Princess Alaia, seeking the royal necklace that protects the kingdom. Russell's childhood friend, Sir Sigbert (now Grand Cross Knight), convinces him to take up his sword once more.
The journey isn't just about saving the princess—it's about Russell learning to forgive himself and rediscovering the hero within.
