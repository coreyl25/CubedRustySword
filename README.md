Rusty Sword Cubed Edition

Overview
Rusty Sword Cubed Edition is a 3D action-adventure RPG that acts as a direct sequel to the OG Rusty Sword. Following his swift defeat at the hands of Russell months prior, Malor decides if he can’t steal the amulet from Princess Aliana he’ll make one himself. However Malor’s attempt at dark magic backfires horribly, instead of granting him power to rule the world, the world was instead transformed into an amalgamation of low resolution polygons. Russell must now set out yet again across the forest, mountains, and demon castle to defeat Malor, destroy his amulet, and return the world back to normal.

This project operates in a 3D perspective and is a complete reimagining of the original 2D side-scrolling platformer. The game now features Mario-like combat, defeating enemies via head jumps but operates in a 3D space giving an elden ring-esque outlook.
